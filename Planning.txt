Todo:
0. Fix storage 
0.5 Create test run
1.Add editText setters
1.5 Add button to routine list to "select" current routine
2. Begin Execute



-Minor things
	-Make input field on text display current name before being edited (currently just blank when opened)
	-Be able to change order of days/exercises by dragging
	-"Are you sure" pop up before deleting 
	-Able to enter seperate time/reps for each set of exercise
	-Be able to change weight increase per session for exercise 
	-Change xml generation so it doesnt remove and regen everytime(inefficient?)


EXECUTE PLANNING: 
-Opening execute shows list of days from routine selected
-Clicking day shows list of exercises
-Clicking excersie opens Input to enter weight/rep of exercise
-Finish saves info (Need to create class to store "stats") for that set
-Timer starts for rest time 


Stats: 
Each day has seperate stat object 
	-Need to store
		-Day being executed 
			-Day Stat object 
		-Stats for each set of exercise (weight, reps) and need to associate it with the set 
			-Set Object 
				-Reps 
				-Weight 
				-Set ID (Maybe not needed, store sets in array and use index as set ID?)
		-For each exercise, we would want info on that exercise from the same rountine, but maybe from different day.  
			-Within each exercise, we would need set info. Array list of sets probably fine tbh 
			-exerciseStat Object 
				-Arraylist of Sets 
				-Date 
				-Name 
	-Main Use cases
		-Accessing stats on an exercise only basis (Doing exercise and seeing previous reps/weights)
			-Store exerciseStat in arraylist, with first one being the latest. Scope is within routine 
			-RoutineStat
				->ExerciseStatArrayList containing exerciseStat, with 0 being latest 
					-exerciseStat contains ArrayList of sets, date and name of exercise 
				->ExerciseStatArrayList2 etc....
		-Accessing stats on entire previous workout basis (view as entire day)
			-DayStat
				-> exerciseStat of that day 
		
		
-Saving Info 
	-No change actually occurs to routine in execute
	-Saving info= Creating new stat objects and adding them to routine's history
	-Don't link stat objects to routine objects, theyre just read only. 
	
				
Stat objects organized so that 





Structure:
-"Routines" array to contain all workout routines 
-"Workout"  arrays contain each "day"
-Each "day" contains list of exercises 
-"Exercise" obeject contains
	- Name
	- Reps
	- Sets
	- Weight'
