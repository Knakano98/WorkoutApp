Todo:
0. Fix storage 
0.5 Create test run
1.Add editText setters
1.5 Add button to routine list to "select" current routine
2. Begin Execute



-Minor things
	-Make input field on text display current name before being edited (currently just blank when opened)
	-Be able to change order of days/exercises by dragging
	-"Are you sure" pop up before deleting 
	-Able to enter seperate time/reps for each set of exercise
	-Be able to change weight increase per session for exercise 
	-Change xml generation so it doesnt remove and regen everytime(inefficient?)


EXECUTE PLANNING: 
-Opening execute shows list of days from routine selected
-Clicking day shows list of exercises
-Clicking routine opens Input to enter weight/rep of exercise
-Finish saves info (Need to create class to store "stats") for that set
-Timer starts for rest time 



Structure:
-"Routines" array to contain all workout routines 
-"Workout"  arrays contain each "day"
-Each "day" contains list of exercises 
-"Exercise" obeject contains
	- Name
	- Reps
	- Sets
	- Weight'
