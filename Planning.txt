ABANDONED: REFACTORING







Workout App Features
1. Able to enter custom workout plan 
2. Able to enter exercise with custom reps/sets


Long term Todo:
1. Get initial XML set up for routine list done
2. Get buttons working and connected with dummy routine info input
	-Create routine will add prefined routine info into the list for testing
3. Get delete/edit working (Edit can just change the name to something to test) 

4. Initial set up XML for day list 
5. Get button working and connected with dummy exercise info input
	-Create routine will add prefined exercise info into the list for testing
3. Get delete/edit working (Edit can just change the name to something to test) 

6. Brainstorm exercise 


PROBLEM BIG PROBLEM:
With way I structured it, cannot use any of the methods to alter main in the other activities WHICH IS BAD 
potential solutions
	1. Structure so that every change passes a change back into mainActivity, and then alters it in there 
		-Sharedpreferences?

		
	2. Pass main into every new activity so it can displayin new activity (Essentially, all altering occurs in main) 
		-Singleton for access? 
	

GENERALLY: Need to pass main into activity that comes before input activity, then create a copy and pass into the input activity
	-Alter the copy in the input, then pass that copy back into main and update "main" main

-Plan concrete from bottom up(Exercise input->Day input->routine input) 


Activities:
In order to access/edit each routine/day, just needs to have index of each in main
Create passes -1 to indicate new one being created, otherwise number is index 

-Need to figure out delete 

What happens when I need to add/delete/update exercise
In any case that exercise is being interacted with, index for routine/day is already there 

Start full work on routine activity, need to get the dynamic list thing working first




1. Select/Edit 
	- Main activity has list of workouts with a title
		- Clicking workout leads to new activity which contains days of workout
			-Clicking each day leads to list of exercises per day 
				-Exercises can be added/removed
				-Clicking on each individual exercise allows editing of Name, reps, sets
			-Can add new day 
		-Can add new workout


-Activities that need to be made
	-Main activity for sEdit
	-Template activity for each routine
	-Template activity for each day
	-Template activity for each exercise

	-Creation input template for routnie
	-Creation input template for day
	-Creation input template for exercise 


Structure:
-"Routines" array to contain all workout routines 
-"Workout"  arrays contain each "day"
-Each "day" contains list of exercises 
-"Exercise" obeject contains
	- Name
	- Reps
	- Sets
	- Weight'
